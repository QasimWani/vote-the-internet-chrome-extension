# vote-the-internet-chrome_extension
Chrome extension to upvote/downvote websites based on their content. Crowrdsourcing trust.

### Gist:
Information is growing at rates incomprehensible to humans. Over 5,000 academic papers are published each day. With an abundance of information, it has become increasingly evident that filtering out jargon and misinformation from the internet is a vital part of free speech to help us make better informed decisions. 
Vote the Internet is a browser extension that crowdsources trust by allowing people to vote on the content of any website. This enables our users to preview credibility statistics of any website prior to opening it (version 1 - released on March 18, 2020).
In our future releases, our users will be able to do the following:
1. Categorize websites based on their topics such as business, sports, politics, etc. This will serve as a productive tool for our users in understanding which areas interest them the most.
2. Summarize web content. This will enable our users to quickly summarize the content on any web page fueled by our arsenal of Machine Learning algorithms.
3. Highlight content. Find any piece interesting? Well, just highlight it then! We will equip our users with the ability to annotate on any web page and provide our users with the ability to make their annotations public for everyone else to see (it's private by default) to engage in conversations and explore different perspectives.

Our mission is simple - become the "verb" of the Internet. How you feel, react, and think should drive progress across 4.5 billion Internet users.
